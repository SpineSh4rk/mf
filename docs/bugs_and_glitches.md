# Bugs and Glitches
These are known bugs and glitches in the game: code that clearly does not work as intended or was designed poorly. Some of them cause visible gameplay issues, while others are harmless. The bugs listed here can be fixed by compiling with the `BUGFIX` flag (bugs in the TODO section don't have a fix implemented yet).

## Bugs

### Y-flipped Zoro uses the wrong size for top hitbox

**Fix:** Edit `ZoroSetHitboxAndDrawDistance` in [zoro.c](../src/sprites_AI/zoro.c) to make the `hitboxTop` value negative.

```diff
  if (gCurrentSprite.status & SPRITE_STATUS_Y_FLIP)
  {
-     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f); // BUG: Should be negative
+     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxBottom = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxLeft = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxRight = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
  }
```

### Y-flipped Sciser uses the wrong size for top hitbox

**Fix:** Edit `SciserUpdateHitbox` in [sciser.c](../src/sprites_AI/sciser.c) to make the `hitboxTop` value negative.

```diff
  if (gCurrentSprite.status & SPRITE_STATUS_Y_FLIP)
  {
-     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f); // BUG: Should be negative
+     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxBottom = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(1.125f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxLeft = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.75f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxRight = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.75f); 
  }
```

### Kihunter hives don't check if spawning a Kihunter failed

When spawning a new sprite, if all the sprite slots are full, the spawn function will return 0xFF instead of a sprite data index. When kihunter hives spawn a kihunter, it uses the return value to index `gSpriteData` and set some values. If spawning fails, the index will be out of bounds.

**Note:** Kihunter hives don't appear in the final game, so this code was likely unfinished/untested.

**Fix:** Edit `KihunterHiveSpawnKihunter` in [kihunter.c](../src/sprites_AI/kihunter.c) to check the spawn function return value before modifying data on the sprite.

```diff
  ramSlot = SpriteSpawnPrimary(PSPRITE_KIHUNTER_FLYING, 0, gCurrentSprite.spritesetGfxSlot, SSP_X_ABSORBABLE_BY_SAMUS,
      gCurrentSprite.yPosition + BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(2.0f), gCurrentSprite.xPosition, flip);
- // BUG: Doesn't check if spawning failed, so ramSlot can go out of bounds
+ if (ramSlot != UCHAR_MAX)
  {
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].pose = SPRITE_POSE_SPAWNING_FROM_X_INIT;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].status |= SPRITE_STATUS_MOSAIC | SPRITE_STATUS_IGNORE_PROJECTILES;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].status &= ~SPRITE_STATUS_HIDDEN;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].properties &= ~SP_CAN_ABSORB_X;
  }
```

### SA-X sprite AI has wrong declaration for `sSamusCollisionData`

The function `SaXSeeAndLocateSamus` in the SA-X sprite AI accesses `sSamusCollisionData` as if it has 6 items per pose, even though there are actually 5. The result is that the value read will be an unexpected or invalid hitbox type. In practice, this only has a minor effect on the SA-X's detection of Samus.

**Fix:** Edit [sa_x.c](../src/sprites_AI/sa_x.c) to remove the incorrect declaration and include samus_data.h instead.

```diff
- // Incorrectly declared here to produce matching code in SaXSeeAndLocateSamus
- extern const u8 sSamusCollisionData[SPOSE_END][6];
+ #include "data/samus_data.h"
```

### Sprites that rotate toward a target will never target directly up

Beam Core-X eyes and BOX's missiles rotate in order to target Samus. The condition for Samus being directly above the sprite is checked, but the result is not used due to a typo, so other conditions are checked instead. Note that sprites can still aim up while rotating, but will never remain aiming up. If Samus is directly above, sprites will aim up-left or up-right instead.

**Fix:** Edit `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget` in [sprite_util.c](../src/spite_util.c) to change the condition after the "directly above" check to `else if` instead of `if`.

```diff
  if (spriteX - BLOCK_SIZE < targetX && spriteX + BLOCK_SIZE > targetX)
  {
      // Target is directly above sprite
      targetRotation = Q_8_8(6.f / 8);
  }
- // BUG: Should be "else if"
- if (targetX > spriteX)
+ else if (targetX > spriteX)
  {
      // Target is right of sprite
      if (spriteY - targetY < BLOCK_SIZE)
      {
          // Target is directly right of sprite
          targetRotation = 0;
      }
      else
      {
          // Target is above and right of sprite
          targetRotation = Q_8_8(7.f / 8);
      }
  }
```

### Arm cannon OAM data for crouching while facing right is malformed

When crouching and facing right with the arm cannon direction set to none, the arm cannon isn't displayed. This is because the OAM data seems to be shifted by 2 bytes somehow, with the part count missing, and an extra 0 at the end. This was likely missed because the only way to get an arm cannon direction of none while crouching is to jump on an enemy close to a ceiling. Normally, the arm cannon direction is set to forward as expected.

**Fix:** Edit `sArmCannonOam_ShootingAndCrouching_None_Right_Frame0` in [arm_cannon_data.c](../src/data/samus/arm_cannon_data.c) to add the part count and remove the trailing 0.

```diff
  static const u16 sArmCannonOam_ShootingAndCrouching_None_Right_Frame0[OAM_DATA_SIZE(3)] = {
+     3 | ARM_CANNON_OAM_ORDER_BEHIND,
      OAM_ENTRY(1, -28, OAM_DIMS_16x16, OAM_NO_FLIP, 0x42, 1, 0),
      OAM_ENTRY(1, -12, OAM_DIMS_16x16, OAM_NO_FLIP, 0x44, 1, 0),
      OAM_ENTRY(11, -16, OAM_DIMS_8x8, OAM_NO_FLIP, 0x5f, 1, 0),
-     0
  };
```


## Oversights and Design Flaws

### `ClipdataConvertToCollision` is copied to RAM but still runs in ROM

`ClipdataConvertToCollision` is copied to RAM, presumably for performance reasons, because it is often called many times per frame and code runs faster in RAM. However, the switch statement gets compiled as a jump table, which ends up jumping to the code in ROM.

**Fix:** Convert the switch statement to a series of if statements. Order them such that common block types (like solid and air) are checked first.

See `ClipdataConvertToCollision` in [clipdata.c](../src/clipdata.c)

### `ClipdataCheckElevatorDisabled` checks every elevator when only one needs to be checked

`ClipdataCheckElevatorDisabled` creates an array for every elevator and stores the disabled state for each one. However, after finishing the loop through `sElevatorDisabledEvents`, only `gLastElevatorUsed` is checked to see if it's disabled.

**Fix:** Edit `ClipdataCheckElevatorDisabled` in [clipdata.c](../src/clipdata.c) to only check `gLastElevatorUsed` and immediately return `TRUE` if it's disabled.

```diff
  // Check for disabled elevators
  j = ARRAY_SIZE(sElevatorDisabledEvents);
  while (j > 0)
  {
      j--;

      // Check in the event range
      if (sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].eventStart <= gEventCounter && gEventCounter < sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].eventEnd)
      {
-         // Apply flags
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_OPERATIONS_DECK]    |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_OPERATIONS_DECK];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_LOBBY]              |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_LOBBY];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_1]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_1];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_2]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_2];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_4]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_4];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_5]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_5];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_6]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_6];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_3]           |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_SECTOR_3];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_LOBBY_POWER_OUTAGE] |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_LOBBY_POWER_OUTAGE];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_HABITATIONS_DECK]   |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_MAIN_DECK_TO_HABITATIONS_DECK];
-         disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_RESTRICTED_ZONE_TO_SECTOR_1]     |= sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[ELEVATOR_RESTRICTED_ZONE_TO_SECTOR_1];
+         if (sElevatorDisabledEvents[j].disabledElevators[gLastElevatorUsed])
+             return TRUE;
      }
  }

- j = disabledElevators[gLastElevatorUsed];

- if (j)
-     return j;
```

### `BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` has duplicate code from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget`

`BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` contains code for calculating the target angle and new rotation that was likely directly copied from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget`. It even includes [the same bug](#sprites-that-rotate-toward-a-target-will-never-target-directly-up). Given the size and complexity of the code, a function call makes more sense.

**Fix:** Edit `BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` in [beam_core_x.c](../src/sprites_AI/beam_core_x.c) to replace all of the code from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget` with a function call. Also remove the local variables `intensity` and `targetRotation`.

```diff
- u8 intensity;
- s32 targetRotation;

  ...

- intensity = Q_8_8(1.f / 128);

  ...

- // OVERSIGHT: This is copied from SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget
- if (targetY < spriteY)
- {
-     ...
- }
-
- ...
-
- else if (targetRotation == Q_8_8(7.f / 8))
- {
-     ...
- }
+ oamRotation = SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget(oamRotation, targetY, targetX, spriteY, spriteX);
```

### The BOX fight can be triggered without triggering the screen shake

To trigger the first BOX fight, the game calls `EventCheckRoomEventTrigger` to check if Samus is in a certain range and sets `EVENT_TRIGGERED_BOX_RUMBLE` if so. To trigger the screen shake, the game checks for both the event being set and Samus being within a certain range of the "ceiling debris" sprite. However, the screen shake range is smaller than the event range, so the screen shake can be skipped. Since having two range checks is redundant, the screen shake range check can be removed.

**Fix:** In [shake_trigger.c](../src/sprites_AI/shake_trigger.c), delete `PreBoxCeilingDebrisCheckSamusInRange` and remove the function call in `PreBoxCeilingDebris`.

```diff
  case SPRITE_POSE_IDLE:
-     if (PreBoxCeilingDebrisCheckSamusInRange(6, 6) && EventCheckOn_BoxRumble())
+     if (EventCheckOn_BoxRumble())
      {
          gCurrentSprite.pose = 0x18;
          gCurrentSprite.pOam = sShakeTriggerOam_TriggeredNotRestrictedLab;
          gCurrentSprite.animationDurationCounter = 0;
          gCurrentSprite.currentAnimationFrame = 0;
          gCurrentSprite.work1 = CONVERT_SECONDS(1.0f);
      }
      break;
```
