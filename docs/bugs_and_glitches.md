# Bugs and Glitches
These are known bugs and glitches in the game: code that clearly does not work as intended or was designed poorly. Some of them cause visible gameplay issues, while others are harmless. The bugs listed here can be fixed by compiling with the `BUGFIX` flag (bugs in the TODO section don't have a fix implemented yet).

## Bugs

### Y-flipped Zoro uses the wrong size for top hitbox

**Fix:** Edit `ZoroSetHitboxAndDrawDistance` in [zoro.c](../src/sprites_AI/zoro.c) to make the `hitboxTop` value negative.

```diff
  if (gCurrentSprite.status & SPRITE_STATUS_Y_FLIP)
  {
-     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f); // BUG: Should be negative
+     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxBottom = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxLeft = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxRight = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.9375f);
  }
```

### Y-flipped Sciser uses the wrong size for top hitbox

**Fix:** Edit `SciserUpdateHitbox` in [sciser.c](../src/sprites_AI/sciser.c) to make the `hitboxTop` value negative.

```diff
  if (gCurrentSprite.status & SPRITE_STATUS_Y_FLIP)
  {
-     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f); // BUG: Should be negative
+     gCurrentSprite.hitboxTop = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.25f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxBottom = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(1.125f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxLeft = -BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.75f);
      gCurrentSprite.hitboxRight = BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(0.75f); 
  }
```

### Kihunter hives don't check if spawning a Kihunter failed

When spawning a new sprite, if all the sprite slots are full, the spawn function will return 0xFF instead of a sprite data index. When kihunter hives spawn a kihunter, it uses the return value to index `gSpriteData` and set some values. If spawning fails, the index will be out of bounds.

**Note:** Kihunter hives don't appear in the final game, so this code was likely unfinished/untested.

**Fix:** Edit `KihunterHiveSpawnKihunter` in [kihunter.c](../src/sprites_AI/kihunter.c) to check the spawn function return value before modifying data on the sprite.

```diff
  ramSlot = SpriteSpawnPrimary(PSPRITE_KIHUNTER_FLYING, 0, gCurrentSprite.spritesetGfxSlot, SSP_X_ABSORBABLE_BY_SAMUS,
      gCurrentSprite.yPosition + BLOCK_TO_SUB_PIXEL(2.0f), gCurrentSprite.xPosition, flip);
- // BUG: Doesn't check if spawning failed, so ramSlot can go out of bounds
+ if (ramSlot != UCHAR_MAX)
  {
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].pose = SPRITE_POSE_SPAWNING_FROM_X_INIT;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].status |= SPRITE_STATUS_MOSAIC | SPRITE_STATUS_IGNORE_PROJECTILES;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].status &= ~SPRITE_STATUS_HIDDEN;
      gSpriteData[ramSlot].properties &= ~SP_CAN_ABSORB_X;
  }
```

### SA-X sprite AI has wrong declaration for `sSamusCollisionData`

The function `SaXSeeAndLocateSamus` in the SA-X sprite AI accesses `sSamusCollisionData` as if it has 6 items per pose, even though there are actually 5. The result is that the value read will be an unexpected or invalid hitbox type. In practice, this only has a minor effect on the SA-X's detection of Samus.

**Fix:** Edit [sa_x.c](../src/sprites_AI/sa_x.c) to remove the incorrect declaration and include samus_data.h instead.

```diff
- // Incorrectly declared here to produce matching code in SaXSeeAndLocateSamus
- extern const u8 sSamusCollisionData[SPOSE_END][6];
+ #include "data/samus_data.h"
```

### Sprites that rotate toward a target will never target directly up

Beam Core-X eyes and BOX's missiles rotate in order to target Samus. The condition for Samus being directly above the sprite is checked, but the result is not used due to a typo, so other conditions are checked instead. Note that sprites can still aim up while rotating, but will never remain aiming up. If Samus is directly above, sprites will aim up-left or up-right instead.

**Fix:** Edit `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget` in [sprite_util.c](../src/spite_util.c) to change the condition after the "directly above" check to `else if` instead of `if`.

```diff
  if (spriteX - BLOCK_SIZE < targetX && spriteX + BLOCK_SIZE > targetX)
  {
      // Target is directly above sprite
      targetRotation = Q_8_8(6.f / 8);
  }
- // BUG: Should be "else if"
- if (targetX > spriteX)
+ else if (targetX > spriteX)
  {
      // Target is right of sprite
      if (spriteY - targetY < BLOCK_SIZE)
      {
          // Target is directly right of sprite
          targetRotation = 0;
      }
      else
      {
          // Target is above and right of sprite
          targetRotation = Q_8_8(7.f / 8);
      }
  }
```


## Oversights and Design Flaws

### `BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` copies code from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget`

`BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` contains code for calculating the target angle and new rotation that was likely directly copied from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget`. It even includes [the same bug](#sprites-that-rotate-toward-a-target-will-never-target-directly-up). Given the size and complexity of the code, a function call makes more sense.

**Fix:** Edit `BeamCoreXEyeHandleRotation` in [beam_core_x.c](../src/sprites_AI/beam_core_x.c) to replace all of the code from `SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget` with a function call. Also remove the local variables `intensity` and `targetRotation`.

```diff
- u8 intensity;
- s32 targetRotation;

  ...

- intensity = Q_8_8(1.f / 128);

  ...

- // OVERSIGHT: This is copied from SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget
- if (targetY < spriteY)
- {
-     ...
- }
-
- ...
-
- else if (targetRotation == Q_8_8(7.f / 8))
- {
-     ...
- }
+ oamRotation = SpriteUtilMakeSpriteRotateTowardsTarget(oamRotation, targetY, targetX, spriteY, spriteX);
```

### The BOX fight can be triggered without triggering the screen shake

To trigger the first BOX fight, the game calls `EventCheckRoomEventTrigger` to check if Samus is in a certain range and sets `EVENT_TRIGGERED_BOX_RUMBLE` if so. To trigger the screen shake, the game checks for both the event being set and Samus being within a certain range of the "ceiling debris" sprite. However, the screen shake range is smaller than the event range, so the screen shake can be skipped. Since having two range checks is redundant, the screen shake range check can be removed.

**Fix:** In [shake_trigger.c](../src/sprites_AI/shake_trigger.c), delete `PreBoxCeilingDebrisCheckSamusInRange` and remove the function call in `PreBoxCeilingDebris`.

```diff
  case SPRITE_POSE_IDLE:
-     if (PreBoxCeilingDebrisCheckSamusInRange(6, 6) && EventCheckOn_BoxRumble())
+     if (EventCheckOn_BoxRumble())
      {
          gCurrentSprite.pose = 0x18;
          gCurrentSprite.pOam = sShakeTriggerOam_TriggeredNotRestrictedLab;
          gCurrentSprite.animationDurationCounter = 0;
          gCurrentSprite.currentAnimationFrame = 0;
          gCurrentSprite.work1 = CONVERT_SECONDS(1.0f);
      }
      break;
```
